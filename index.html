      <center> “Any woman who has ever told me to love myself and that I’m perfect have all been skinny women. It’s
        really easy to attack other women for succumbing to, or promoting the beauty standard when you were born into
        it”

  <h2 >What is Body Neutrality?</h2>
  <h5 class= "font"> "The movement in which you accept yourself as you are when loving yourself feels like a task that is too hard to
    complete. It doesn't matter if you think your body is beautiful or not. Your value is not tied to your body nor does
    your happiness depend on what you look like. Body neutrality is far more beneficial of a mindset to have than
      body positivity. Rather than always being in a forced superficial state of loving yourself, respecting your
    body for what it's capable of doing is a mindset that places less emphasis on how you look, but how you feel."</h5>
