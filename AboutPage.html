    <h2>Maddi's Story</h2>
    <p>To me having a neutral mindset about your body allows you to feel comfortable in your own skin. As someone who has struggled with an eating disorder for  several years now I feel that it is important to learn to accept your body for what it is and not always have the expectation that you are going to be in love with your body every second of everyday. This concept of having a neutral mindset about my body has helped me recover and grow as a person and sharing that message with others is something that is very close to my heart </p>

    <h2>Sophia's Story</h2>
    <p>Most people that I have talked to have gone through some form of disordered eating because of their body image, including myself. Body neutrality takes off the pressure on myself to not always feel content with  my body everyday, but rather respect it for what it is capable of doing for me. As I’ve developed a healthier relationship with my body since middle school, accepting my body for what is has made me more content than convincing myself of a false view I have on myself.
This is a movement that I believe has an easier mindset to adopt.

    <h2>Neeva's Story</h2>
    <p>This topic resonates with me deeply. In my personal experience, I have had an eating disorder in the past years and still struggle with body image to this day. Body neutrality has helped me recover and made me view my internal worth more than my external self. I have struggled with the idea of loving my body, and never fully understood the idea of body positivity. For me, it felt more fake than it did realistic. I always longed to love myself as much as the people that I saw on social media did. I just didn’t understand what they where doing that I wasn’t. I realize now, that it is unrealistic to always have a great day. And that nobody can ever love everything about themselves. There is a difference between being optimistic and being so blissfully unrealistic.

  The Neutrality Project has an overall mission to inform our audience about the new concept of body neutrality. This movement is different from body positivity, which can often feel fake and insincere as it pressures you to love every aspect of your body. Instead, this concept introduces you to the idea of accepting yourself as you are when loving yourself feels like a task that is too hard to complete.Instead, it doesn't matter if you think your body is beautiful or not. Your value is not tied to your body nor does your happiness depend on what you look like
